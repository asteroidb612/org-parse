* Jobs Invite Emails
** Definitions
*** Add new company to jobs market -> superadmin update happens setting the jobsMarket flag
*** 
** Orthogonal
*** Ask TJ how mongoose gets hooked up through services. BlackMagicFuckery
* REVIEWING Remove sandbox from intro/unmasking flow
  CLOSED: [2018-02-22 Thu 17:35]
** Clarification
*** Is the new intro/unmasking flow "Would you hire/work with them?" or Unmask at the end of an interview?
*** Possibly update faq to reflect how de-anonymize works?
** There's a [[file:client/app/interview/controllers/interview.live.js::if%20($scope.interview.introduced%20||%20_.get($scope.interview,%20'_org.accountSettings.disableIntro'))%20{][flag]] checked when considering intro -> Added Sandbox
** Orthogonal 
   Is there a stripped down object that at least has the UI decisions for an org if we'd rather be lean?
Is [[file:server/api/employer/employer.model.js::EmployerModel.getUserFacingEmployerData%20=%20async%20function(employerIds)%20{][this]] that?

* Org File parser in Elm
** Rationale
*** Elm has nice parsers
*** Elm has nice UI building
*** Elm has an emacs crowd, probably
** Steps
*** Parse subset of emacs org syntax in elm
*** Generate a nice one-way ui off of that AST
*** Make a two way binding between an org-file-string and a ui
**** Mode 1 only edits things like visibility, toggles, todos, etc
**** Mode 2 can edit eh-ver-ee-thingggg 
*** Make a port so js people can use it and appreciate elm
*** Dig into client side file management
**** Can I read the org files given a .git blob?
***** And maybe write a commit with modifications?

* @And How
** @Distractions
*** Programmer health. Why does my watch hurt. How can I not need caroptonulgloves
*** Can I get a magit shortcut? Global keymap that like , is for main mode?
*** What are typical access rates for our DB?
*** Prettier option to put chained methods on one line if reasonable?
*** names for TODO
*** Is muzak more tollerable if computer generate? Existentially?
*** Make times noticeable?
*** Debugger prevents server restart from file change
*** Speed up dotfiles.git with ignores
** @Cadence
 - Define timer validity better
 - Phillz geek out with Ana
** @DB
   mongodump --host  candidate.68.mongolayer.com --port 10161 --db app29596024 -u drew 

   mongo
     db.dropDatabase()
     db.copyDatabase('app29596024', 'interviewingio-dev')
** @Debugging
   npx grunt serve --inspect
   (in chrome) about:inspect
** @Pull Request Precheck
*** Do your new variable names make sense given their context?
**** e.g. You moved all the orgSupportsAvailability logic to the Employer.Model without adjusting
*** Can you remove a db call in some cases? 
**** e.g. You could skip ModelEmployers.find for empty lists in user.controller.me
*** Don't use var on the server.
**** "In these cases, they are const (otherwise let)." -tj
*** camelCase
*** Are you using the libraries well?
There was a lodash function to _.clamp values
There was a between_moments function while you did two seperate comparisons.
** @Dissections
*** Recording, streaming of interview sessions.

*** Availabilities are augmented [[file:server/api/availability/availability.model.js::availabilityId:%20availability._id.toString(),][here]] but incremented somewhere else
**** They are also renamed, _id in the db but availabilityId in link
